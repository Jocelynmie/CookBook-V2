The system automatically generates a comprehensive shopping list with precise quantities and units for all required ingredients, eliminating daily grocery trips and serving the needs of busy working professionals.

## Features

### Recipe Management

- Add new recipes with ingredients, quantities, and cooking instructions
- Browse personal recipe collection with filtering options
- Edit existing recipes to adjust ingredients or instructions
- Delete unwanted recipes from the collection
- Search functionality to find recipes by name or ingredients

### Meal Planning

- Select meals for the upcoming week from the recipe collection
- Make last-minute adjustments to the weekly plan
- Save favorite meal plans as templates for future weeks
- Visual calendar for meal organization
- Support for breakfast, lunch, dinner categorization

### Automated Grocery List

- Generate consolidated shopping lists based on selected weekly meals
- Automatically calculate total quantities needed for each ingredient
- Option to export or share the shopping list
- Smart categorization of ingredients by grocery store sections
- Mark items as purchased during shopping

## Technical Stack

### Frontend

- React.js: The application uses React for building the user interface components
- React Router: Used for navigation between different pages
- CSS: Custom styling with component-specific CSS files
- Prop-Types: Used for component prop validation

### Backend

- Node.js: JavaScript runtime environment for the server
- Express.js: Web application framework for handling HTTP requests
- MongoDB: NoSQL database used for storing recipes, meal plans, and user suggestions
- MongoDB Native Driver: Used for database connectivity

### Development Tools

- ESLint: JavaScript code quality tool for identifying and fixing problems in code
- Prettier: Code formatter that enforces consistent style across project
- Nodemon: Development utility that automatically restarts Node.js applications when file changes are detected
- Git: Version control system for tracking changes and collaborating on code
  dotenv: Module for loading environment variables from a .env file into process.env
- npm: Package manager for JavaScript, used to install and manage project dependencies

## Describe any use of GenAI

Claude 3.7 Sonent

- 1.Project Structure Analysis: AI was likely used to analyze the difference between www.js and server.js files, helping determine the optimal server initialization approach.
- 2.Vercel Deployment Configuration: AI assistance for creating or optimizing the vercel.json configuration file for deployment on Vercel's platform.
- 3.Component Design Consultation: Guidance on component reusability patterns, specifically addressing how components can function both with parent-provided props and through independent API data fetching.
- 4.Architecture Analysis: Analysis of component relationships and prop passing patterns throughout the application.
- 5.Data Generation: Converting JSON to CSV format for MongoDB import and generating sample data (approximately 1,000 records) for development and testing purposes.
